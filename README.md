### 🌟 Yyyhello 👋 Gustav Kramnäs™️ 🌟
I am 25 years old. Born and raised in Stockholm, Sweden. Right now i am currently studying to become a Front End developer at Hyper Island. I am an all-rounder and love to try new things and try to learn a lot of things along the way. I am a person who goes against the grain in the mainstream direction and does what I feel like. Right now I'm really into tech and business.

### 💀Short about me💀
Besides from coding, in addition to coding and learning to code, I practice football, running and strength training. I am quite spiritual and like to do rituals that strengthen my mind, focus and well-being. I am also very interested in cooking, wines (preferably from Spain) investments in general and small businessess. A dream trip is to experience national parks around the world.
