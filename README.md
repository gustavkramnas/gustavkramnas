### 💀Short about me💀
Besides from coding, in addition to coding and learning to code, I practice football, running and strength training. I am quite spiritual and aware of my mind, focus and well-being. I am also very interested in cooking, wines, investments in general and starting businessess. A dream trip is to experience national parks around the world.
